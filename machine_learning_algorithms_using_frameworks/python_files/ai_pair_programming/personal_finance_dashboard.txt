Project: Personal Finance Dashboard (Using Flask, SQLite, Chart.js, and User Authentication)

A more complex web development project is a Personal Finance Dashboard. This web app will:

Allow users to register and log in (Flask-Login).
Track income and expenses (Flask-SQLAlchemy for database storage).
Display a finance summary with charts (Chart.js for visualizations).
Enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete for transactions).

This project introduces authentication, data visualization, and CRUD operations.
