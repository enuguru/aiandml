upload the Pima Indians diabetes prediction training dataset and the testing dataset

Then give the following prompt in chatGPT.

The Pima Indians diabetes dataset is attached here. There are two csv files provided here one for training and one for testing. The test dataset has only 8 variables which are features of the data, there is not target variable in test dataset. You have to predict the target.

first read training data csv file. The first 8 columns are the features of the data. The last column is the output or the target variable.

Please give me the learning algorithm in python for the classification model that uses KNN algorithm. Please use  the frameworks NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib. 

First select the KNN algorithm, then train the model and do the testing after reading the test data file provided and predicting using the KNN algorithm, classification model

Finally print the output of the testing of the model using the test data provided.

after the chatGPT predicts the output

give this prompt

give me the learning algorithm in python, give me the python code. Give me the python code for evaluating the model and printing the results
