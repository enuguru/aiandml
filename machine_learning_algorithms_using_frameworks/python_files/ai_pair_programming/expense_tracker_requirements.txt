Project: Expense Tracker Web App (Using Flask and SQLite)

A slightly more difficult web development project using Flask is an Expense Tracker. This app will allow users to:

Add expenses (description, amount, category).
View all expenses in a table.
Delete expenses.
Store data in SQLite (instead of an in-memory list).
This introduces database handling using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
